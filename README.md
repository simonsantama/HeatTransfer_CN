# HeatTransfer_CN
Crank-Nicholson solver for a 1-D heat transfer model. Accomodates different boundary conditions.

Accepts constant surface temperature, constant NHF, convection and convection + radiation as surface boundary conditions.
Accepts semi-infinite, insulated or contact with aluminium block for back face boundary condition.
