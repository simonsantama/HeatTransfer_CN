# HeatTransfer_CN
Crank-Nicholson solver for a 1-D heat transfer model.

1. Folder Test_Validation:

Accepts constant surface temperature, constant NHF, convection and convection + radiaiton as surface
boundary conditions (validated against the analytical solutions).

2. Folder Thesis_Implementation:
Uses the CN_model to predict the thermal response of PMMA, PA6 and Timber. This is used to understand the 
evolution of the heat losses (surface and back) as a function of the imposed boundary condition.
