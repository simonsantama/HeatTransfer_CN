# HeatTransfer_CN
Crank-Nicholson solver for a 1-D heat transfer model.
Constant properties, homogenous and inert solid.

1. Folder test_validation:

Heat diffusion in a semi-infinite solid with Dirichlet, Neunman and Robin boundary conditions validated against the analytical
solutions.

2. Folder implementation:
Uses the Crank-Nicolson scheme to predict the inert, thermal response of PMMA, PA6 and Timber exposed to external radiation (function of time) with convective and radiative
losses at the exposed surface and conductive losses to an aluminium block on the back surface.
